# Mesh Bridge: Positioning & Roadmap

> Strategic plan for simplifying, positioning, and growing mesh-bridge into a significant open source project.

## 🎯 The Core Insight

**The DOM is the wrong abstraction layer for AI agents.**

The DOM is:
- Too granular (thousands of nodes)
- Too unstable (changes with UI updates)
- Too verbose (massive token budgets)
- Too coupled to visual rendering

Agents that operate directly on the DOM must:
- Re-interpret structure on every interaction
- Spend tokens parsing irrelevant nodes
- Break when minor UI changes happen
- Behave like fragile RPA, not intelligent systems

### The Mesh Bridge Insight

**Instead of teaching agents to navigate the DOM, we pre-compile the DOM into tools.**

```
DOM → Domain Script → MCP Tools → Agent Reasoning
```

This is a **representation collapse**:
1. **Domain scripts** map a site's DOM to stable, named actions
2. **MCP tools** expose intent-level operations (`sendMessage`, `getConversations`)
3. **Agents** never see the DOM—they work with a clean, stable API

Once compiled, the website becomes a **cookbook of guaranteed-to-work actions**.

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Token Reduction Strategy

Instead of:
- Sending thousands of DOM tokens per interaction
- Re-explaining page structure every run
- Hoping the LLM infers intent from layout

You get:
- A small, stable, named toolset
- Predictable inputs & outputs
- Dramatically smaller prompts
- Faster reasoning loops
- Lower inference cost
- Higher success rate

**This is code generation to reduce the agent's problem space.**

### Bidirectional Control Plane

Mesh Bridge works in both directions:
- **MCPs → DOM**: AI agents control the website
- **DOM → MCPs**: Website events trigger MCP workflows

This enables live, agent-driven interaction with real websites—not just background automation.

### Your Browser, Your Session

Mesh Bridge runs in **your actual browser**:
- Your cookies
- Your credentials
- Your existing logins
- Your permissions

No headless Chrome. No credential duplication. No bot detection games. **It just works because you're already logged in.**

## 🏗️ Architecture Simplification Plan

The current architecture is functional but has accidental complexity. Here's how to simplify:

### Current Pain Points

1. **Too much in WhatsApp domain** - System tools (files, shell, clipboard) shouldn't be in a domain
2. **Agent class is complex** - 1200+ lines, handles routing + execution + caching
3. **Extension has too much logic** - Polling, state management, DOM manipulation all mixed
4. **Two entry points** - `stdio.ts` and `main.ts` share code awkwardly

### Proposed Simplification

#### 1. Extract Core Tools from Domains

```
server/
├── tools/
│   ├── system/           # LIST_FILES, READ_FILE, RUN_SHELL
│   ├── speech/           # SAY_TEXT, STOP_SPEAKING  
│   ├── clipboard/        # GET_CLIPBOARD, SET_CLIPBOARD
│   └── notifications/    # SEND_NOTIFICATION
├── domains/
│   └── whatsapp/         # Only WhatsApp-specific tools: SEND_MESSAGE, GET_CHATS
```

**Benefit:** Domains become thin. System tools reusable across domains.

#### 2. Simplify Agent to Pure Router

```typescript
// Current: Agent handles routing + execution + caching + logging
// Proposed: Agent just routes, execution is delegated

class Agent {
  route(message: string): Task
  execute(task: Task): Result
}

class Task {
  tools: ToolRef[]
  plan: string
  context?: string
}
```

**Benefit:** Clearer separation, easier testing, potential for parallel execution.

#### 3. Unify Entry Points

```typescript
// server/index.ts - Single entry point
// Detects mode automatically:
// - If running with MESH_TOKEN env vars → STDIO mode
// - Otherwise → Standalone mode

import { startBridge } from "./bridge";
startBridge();
```

**Benefit:** One mental model, less code duplication.

#### 4. Simplify Extension Protocol

```javascript
// Current: Many frame types, complex state machine
// Proposed: Three operations

sendToAgent(message)        // User → Agent
receiveFromAgent(response)  // Agent → User
executeAction(action)       // Agent → DOM
```

**Benefit:** Extension becomes a thin DOM adapter.

## 📝 README Positioning

The current README is technical and explains "how." The new README should explain "why" and inspire adoption.

### Proposed README Structure

```markdown
# Mesh Bridge

> Compile any website into MCP tools for AI agents.

The DOM is the wrong abstraction for AI. Mesh Bridge pre-compiles websites 
into stable, intent-level tools that agents can use reliably.

## The Problem

AI agents struggle with the web because:
- The DOM is too granular and noisy
- Page structure changes break automations  
- Token budgets explode with raw HTML
- Every interaction requires re-interpretation

## The Solution

Mesh Bridge introduces a **domain script layer** that:
- Maps DOM elements to named actions
- Exposes intent-level MCP tools
- Runs in your real browser (your session, your cookies)
- Works bidirectionally (agents ↔ websites)

## Quick Example

```typescript
// Instead of: "Find the input, type, click send button..."
// You get:

await tools.whatsapp.sendMessage({
  chatId: "self",
  text: "Hello from AI!"
});
```

## How It Works

1. **Domain scripts** understand specific websites (WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc.)
2. **Chrome extension** runs in your browser, watches for commands
3. **Bridge server** connects to your MCP Mesh
4. **AI agents** call tools, Bridge executes on the DOM

[Beautiful architecture diagram here]

## Getting Started

1. Add Mesh Bridge to your MCP Mesh as a Custom Command
2. Load the Chrome extension  
3. Open WhatsApp Web
4. Message yourself: `!hello`
5. AI responds in your chat

## Why This Matters

- **Token reduction**: Small toolset vs massive DOM
- **Reliability**: Stable tools vs fragile selectors
- **Speed**: Instant execution vs DOM interpretation
- **Trust**: Your browser, your session, your data

## Supported Sites

| Site | Status | Tools |
|------|--------|-------|
| WhatsApp Web | ✅ Ready | Messages, chats, voice |
| LinkedIn | 🚧 Coming | Connections, messages |
| X (Twitter) | 🚧 Coming | Tweets, DMs |
| Any site | 📖 Guide | Add your own! |

## Roadmap

## 🛣️ Roadmap: Next Examples to Build

### Tier 1: Core Domains (Next 30 days)

#### 1. LinkedIn Domain
**Why:** High-value, professional context, natural MCP use case
**Tools:**
- `SEND_CONNECTION_REQUEST(profileUrl, note?)`
- `SEND_MESSAGE(conversationId, text)`
- `GET_PROFILE(profileUrl)`
- `SEARCH_PEOPLE(query, filters)`
- `LIST_CONNECTIONS()`

**Extension complexity:** Medium (LinkedIn DOM is cleaner than WhatsApp)

#### 2. X (Twitter) Domain
**Why:** Public API alternative, content creation, engagement automation
**Tools:**
- `POST_TWEET(text, mediaUrls?)`
- `REPLY_TO_TWEET(tweetId, text)`
- `SEND_DM(userId, text)`
- `GET_TIMELINE(count)`
- `SEARCH_TWEETS(query)`

**Extension complexity:** Medium (X has a consistent DOM structure)

#### 3. Gmail Domain
**Why:** Universal use case, high value, complex enough to prove the model
**Tools:**
- `COMPOSE_EMAIL(to, subject, body)`
- `REPLY_TO_EMAIL(threadId, body)`
- `LIST_EMAILS(folder, query, limit)`
- `GET_EMAIL(emailId)`
- `ARCHIVE_EMAIL(emailId)`

**Extension complexity:** High (Gmail DOM is complex, may need React reconciliation)

### Tier 2: Developer Tools (60 days)

#### 4. GitHub Domain
**Why:** Developer workflow, PR reviews, issue management
**Tools:**
- `CREATE_ISSUE(repo, title, body)`
- `COMMENT_ON_PR(prUrl, comment)`
- `APPROVE_PR(prUrl)`
- `LIST_NOTIFICATIONS()`
- `GET_PR_DIFF(prUrl)`

#### 5. Linear Domain
**Why:** Project management, issue tracking, natural agentic workflow
**Tools:**
- `CREATE_ISSUE(title, description, projectId)`
- `UPDATE_ISSUE(issueId, status, assignee)`
- `LIST_ISSUES(projectId, filters)`
- `ADD_COMMENT(issueId, text)`

#### 6. Notion Domain
**Why:** Knowledge base, documentation, content management
**Tools:**
- `CREATE_PAGE(parentId, title, content)`
- `SEARCH_PAGES(query)`
- `UPDATE_PAGE(pageId, content)`
- `GET_DATABASE(databaseId)`

### Tier 3: AI-Generated Domains (90 days)

The ultimate goal: **Generate domain scripts on demand using AI.**

#### Flow:
1. User says: "I want to automate job applications on AngelList"
2. Bridge captures relevant DOM slices
3. LLM analyzes structure and affordances
4. LLM generates:
   - Domain script (server-side)
   - Content script (extension-side)
   - Tool definitions
5. Output: Ready-to-commit folder
6. From then on: Agents use stable tools

#### Components needed:
- **DOM analyzer** - Extracts semantic meaning from DOM
- **Tool generator** - Produces MCP tool definitions
- **Script generator** - Creates server + extension code
- **Test generator** - Validates the domain works

## 🏷️ Naming & Positioning Options

The project needs a clear conceptual frame. Options:

### Option A: "Web Compiler for Agents"
- Emphasizes the compilation metaphor
- DOM → Tools is like Source → Binary
- Clear differentiation from RPA

### Option B: "Agent-Native Web"
- Positions websites as having a "native" agent interface
- Like "mobile-native" vs "responsive"
- Forward-looking, aspirational

### Option C: "DOM-to-MCP Bridge"
- Technical, accurate
- Clear value prop for MCP users
- Less inspiring, more descriptive

### Option D: "Browser Bindings"
- Plays on the MCP bindings concept
- Extends familiar terminology
- Connects to existing Mesh ecosystem

**Recommendation:** Lead with "Web Compiler for Agents" for positioning, use "Mesh Bridge" as product name.

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Write new README** with the positioning above
2. **Create `examples/` folder** with standalone use cases
3. **Extract system tools** from WhatsApp domain
4. **Build LinkedIn domain** as proof of pattern
5. **Record demo video** showing the flow
6. **Write blog post** explaining the insight
7. **Set up Discord** for community

## 🎤 The Elevator Pitch

> "AI agents can't use websites because the DOM is too complex. Mesh Bridge compiles websites into simple MCP tools—like turning a complex machine into a remote control. It runs in your real browser, uses your real session, and turns any website into a toolkit for AI. We're building the interface layer that makes the web agent-native."
